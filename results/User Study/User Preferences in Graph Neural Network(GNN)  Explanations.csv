Interpretability: Refers to the ease with which a human can understand the reasoning behind a model's prediction. In graph machine learning, this means how clearly a model can explain its decisions using the graph's structure, such as highlighting specific nodes or edges that influenced a prediction.
Fidelity: Indicates the accuracy with which the explanation reflects the model's actual decision-making process. High fidelity means the explanation closely mirrors how the model uses the graph's features to arrive at its conclusions, ensuring the explanation is not just understandable, but also truthful to the model's operation.
