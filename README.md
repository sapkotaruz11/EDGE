# EDGE: Evaluation of Diverse Knowledge Graph Explanations

The **EDGE** framework represents a novel approach in evaluating explanations produced by various node classifiers on knowledge graphs. Standing for "Evaluation of Diverse Knowledge Graph Explanations," EDGE integrates an array of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), sub-graph-based GNN explainers, logical explainers, and a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics. This framework is designed to automate the evaluation process, efficiently handling methods within its scope and delivering results in a clear, structured manner. The primary goals of EDGE are to incorporate cutting-edge node classifiers from existing literature, to provide a quantitative assessment of different explainers using multiple metrics, to streamline the evaluation process, and to conduct evaluations using real-world datasets.
